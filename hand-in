Hand-in for compulsory assignment 2

***Compare comparisons used with Ternary Search and Binary Search***
The class classes.searchCompare is the main class used to answer this question.
Things to comment on:
    1. Removed the size method in classes.UBST. Only used in put to recalculate size.
    2. Change from key1 to hiKey and key2 to loKey to emphasize relation between keys.
    3. loKey can never be null, but hiKey can be null.
    4. Did not implement deletion since it made coding easier.
